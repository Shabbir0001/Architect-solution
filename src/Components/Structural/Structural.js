            <p>Structural engineers work on structural design – the design to establish the safest and most economical way a structure is put up so that it can carry the required load. Towards this end, they determine the type, quality, grade, dimensions, etc., of materials that need to be used so that the structure will be able to support itself and additional loads as required. </p>
            <p>Structural engineers are aware of the quality and performance of different types of materials. Their knowledge allows them to design structures using the most suitable structural elements. They have knowledge of how materials will react to external elements, their quality and durability.</p>
            <p>In the technologically advanced world today, structurals are designed with the assistance of specialized software, like AutoCAD and Revit, which enables the engineer to be precise in their designs. These software help to determine the effect of environmental factors like earthquakes and heavy winds on the buildings and other structures and ensure that they are strong and resilient enough to withstand different types of structural loads – like wind, rain, snow, earthquakes, etc., and other things like people and traffic as well.</p>
            <p>BIM is a comprehensive pre construction process which takes care of time, cost, and safety measures. BIM helps in converting design ideas to real time construction. It will also help you track your project from conception stage to as-built drawings.</p>
            <p>Our team at Centreline Studio are specialists in BIM. We have handled and delivered a large number of projects in all sectors using BIM. We have worked as consultants for Architects and Builders. All our projects have maintained high accuracy and have been delivered on schedule.</p>
            <p>The end result of our efforts is that the projects that we complete give stakeholders the benefit of both TIME and COST.</p>
