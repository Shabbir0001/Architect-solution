            <h3>What is Architecture?</h3>
            <p>The dictionary meaning of ‘Architecture’ is – the art or science of building  specifically : the art or practice of designing and building structures and especially habitable ones</p>

            <p>    The Roman architect Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, better known as Vitruvius, from his personal experience considered that architecture should provide three things –  “firmness, commodity and delight”; that is, a building should be stable, useful and beautiful.</p>

            <p>Architecture may be considered as the art and science of designing not only buildings, but also creating spaces giving due importance to both aesthetics and quality, which includes safety, functionality and economy.</p>

            <p> Whether it is a house or a school, a hospital or a college, the architecture should be such that it offers the best to its inhabitants as well as to the surroundings in which it is situated.</p>

            <p> Architecture is not just business. It is a purpose to provide quality design. To help convert what a client envisions into a piece of art. To design and build something that is not only functional and durable but also inspires a feeling of awe.</p>

            <p>BIM is a comprehensive pre construction process which takes care of time, cost, and safety measures. BIM helps in converting design ideas to real time construction. It will also help you track your project from conception stage to as-built drawings.</p>

            <p>Our team at Centreline Studio are specialists in BIM. We have handled and delivered a large number of projects in all sectors using BIM. We have worked as consultants for Architects and Builders. All our projects have maintained high accuracy and have been delivered on schedule.</p>

            <p>The end result of our efforts is that the projects that we complete give stakeholders the benefit of both TIME and COST.</p>
