Families are objects used in the project environment inside Revit. The use of families reduces significant modelling time. We at Centreline studios create intelligent families by incorporating formulas as per your specific requirements. These families will have the capability to automatically adopt as per the requirements and thus reduce the need for creating and loading multiple families. This helps in significantly reducing the size of the projects created."
