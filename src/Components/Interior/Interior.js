            <h1>Interiors</h1>
            <p>The feeling of awe that a building’s exterior inspires should continue inside the building as well. The spaces within buildings – homes, schools, institutions, etc. – should provide pleasant experiences. This is what an interior designer aspires to create.</p>
            <p>Interiors affect the quality of life of the person occupying or visiting that space. So, the interior designers have a lot on their hands. They are expected to know what the clients’ needs are and figure out the best way to fulfill them. </p>
            <p>Interior designers work in tandem with the architects, engineers and builders and they bring to the table their own skills and knowledge. They need to bring knowledge of light, space, colour, furniture, materials, safety norms, etc., along with knowledge of technical aspects like CAD and BIM.</p>
            <p>BIM is a comprehensive pre construction process which takes care of time, cost, and safety measures. BIM helps in converting design ideas to real time construction. It will also help you track your project from conception stage to as-built drawings.</p>
            <p>Our team at Centreline Studio are specialists in BIM. We have handled and delivered a large number of projects in all sectors using BIM. We have worked as consultants for Architects and Builders. All our projects have maintained high accuracy and have been delivered on schedule.</p>
            <p>The end result of our efforts is that the projects that we complete give stakeholders the benefit of both TIME and COST.</p>
